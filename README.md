# Project Overview:
Cardiovascular & Mental Health Analysis in India:
This project explores the early onset of heart disease and mental health disparities across urban and rural India using a comprehensive dataset. It includes key medical, lifestyle, and environmental risk factors. Through visualizations such as donut charts, clustered bar graphs, stacked columns, funnels, pie charts, and KPI cards, we identify contributing factors and provide predictive insights to guide healthcare policies and interventions.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death in India, with heart attacks being a major contributor. Cases are often diagnosed at younger ages compared to Western countries. This analysis focuses on identifying key medical and lifestyle risk factorsâ€”such as diabetes, obesity, smoking, pollution, and healthcare accessâ€”while highlighting urban-rural disparities. The goal is to develop predictive models for early detection and provide insights to improve healthcare interventions in India.

Visualizes heart disease distribution across age groups and genders.

## Clustered Bar Chart:
Shows heart attack cases across Indian states, highlighting regional disparities.

** Stacked Column Chart:**
Displays the total and individual contributions of key health indicators.

Funnel Chart:
Illustrates the relationship between patient count, alcohol consumption, and smoking.

Pie Chart:
Represents the proportions of diabetes, obesity, and total patients in the dataset.

Card:
Summarizes the total number of patients for quick reference.
