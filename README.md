# ðŸ©º Cardiovascular & Mental Health Analysis in India

This project explores the early onset of heart disease and mental health disparities across urban and rural India using a comprehensive healthcare dataset. It incorporates key medical, lifestyle, socioeconomic, and environmental factors to uncover insights and support better healthcare decisions.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death in India, with heart attacks (myocardial infarctions) contributing significantly to the mortality rate. Unlike Western countries, these conditions often emerge at younger ages in India. Urban-rural disparities, lifestyle variations, and access to healthcare further complicate the issue.

The objective of this analysis is to:
- Identify risk factors contributing to early onset of heart disease.
- Develop predictive models for early detection.
- Provide actionable insights to guide healthcare interventions and policy-making.
